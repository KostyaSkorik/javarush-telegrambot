# javarush-telegrambot
A bot for the ability to receive notifications when new articles are published in those groups on JavaRush that I am interested in.

## Deployment
Deployment process as easy as possible:
Required software:
- terminal for running bash scripts
- docker
- docker-compose

to deploy application, switch to needed branch and run bash script:

$ bash start.sh ${bot_username} ${bot_token}

That's all.
